        </h2>

        <p class="mb-6 md:mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          This Lay-by Policy & Agreement governs all lay-by (also known as layaway) transactions between Reserved Designs ("the Company") and the Purchaser ("the Client"). By entering a lay-by arrangement you acknowledge that you have read, understood and accepted these terms, the attached Purchase Invoice and any specific schedule associated with the order.

        </h2>

        <p class="mb-6 md:mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          The lay-by option allows Clients to reserve products — including standard, customised or prototyped units — by paying in instalments over an agreed period before full ownership transfers. The Company remains the legal owner of the goods until the purchase price is paid in full.
        </p>

          <li><strong>Instalments:</strong> The outstanding balance must be paid according to the payment schedule (monthly or otherwise) agreed and attached to this agreement.</li>
          <li><strong>No interest:</strong> No interest or initiation fees apply to lay-by transactions unless expressly stated in the schedule.</li>
          <li><strong>Payment methods:</strong> Payments are accepted by the methods listed on the Purchase Invoice. All payments are due on or before the dates indicated in the schedule.</li>

            All product designs, CAD models, prototypes, manufacturing documentation and intellectual property (collectively "Reserved Designs") remain the exclusive property of Reserved Designs. Purchasing the physical goods under lay-by does not transfer design ownership, nor does it entitle the Purchaser to any digital design files, manufacturing instructions, or reproduction rights unless a separate written licence or transfer agreement is executed.

        <p class="mb-8 md:mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          Goods placed on lay-by are secured at the agreed price on the date of signing. The Purchaser will not receive a price reduction if the retail price falls during the lay-by period. The Company also will not increase the agreed price after the agreement is signed.

          <li>Once the total purchase price is paid in full, the Purchaser must collect the goods within <strong>14 days</strong> from the original store or design studio of purchase, upon presentation of a copy of this agreement, the Purchase Invoice and a valid identity document.</li>
          <li>Failure to collect within 14 days may result in a reasonable storage fee. If goods remain uncollected after <strong>30 days</strong> following full payment, the Company may terminate the agreement and treat the order as cancelled (see Cancellation section).</li>

          <li>The Purchaser may cancel the lay-by at any time prior to final payment. If cancelled: the Company will refund amounts paid, less a <strong>20% termination fee</strong> of the purchase price — unless the goods are custom and production or prototyping has commenced (see clause 7.4).</li>
          <li>If the Purchaser defaults on payments and remains in arrears up to the expiry date on the schedule, the Company may terminate the agreement after giving <strong>14 business days</strong> written notice. Refunds (if any) will be issued within <strong>10 business days</strong> minus the termination fee.</li>
